Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?
Forks- It can be used to copy repository on github
clone- it clones the repository but not the commit history
Branches - we can use branches to save all commit history in one Master Branch
file.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
Having a copy is always better to compare the files after working on some
other project or may be to understand the difference between updated file
remotely as well as locally, it will be helpful when you collaborate your file.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and
what would be harder?
Solutions: would compress the file and upload in google dirve, onedrive then
share it.
But I am pretty sure git would be much better in sharing the files and
collaborating with it.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master? What benefits does each approach have?
We have an option of working out on our new programs or applications before
making sure that program actually works, and then commit to the master branch.
